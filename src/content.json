      "I recently completed my internship as a Trainee Full Stack Developer at Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), where I contributed to building and enhancing enterprise-level applications. During this experience, I worked with React, NestJS, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to develop secure, role-based systems using JWT authentication and Redux for efficient state management. I followed version control best practices using Git and contributed to delivering reliable, production-ready features.",
      "I am passionate about full-stack development and backend architecture, with a strong focus on building secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications. I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing system performance, and continuously improving my technical skills. As a fast learner and team-oriented developer, I aim to contribute to impactful software solutions while growing both personally and professionally."
